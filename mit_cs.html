                <h1>Motivation</h1>
                <p>
                    2020 was a tumultuous time to graduate. Exams cancelled, goodbyes cut short, job offer rescinded, and just when you think things couldn't get any more strange, no more toilet paper!
                    Moving from a full-time offer to part time work, I found myself with a lot of extra time, and very little direction.
                    <br>
                    Though it was not the focus of my undergrad, I had consistently returned to opencourseware in my free time to learn tidbits of python and machine learning.
                    It then became clear that this Covid curveball had given the opportunity to pursue another one of my interests.
                    In September 2020 I decided to pursue an online eductation in computer science and here's how I'm doing it!

                <h1>Where To Begin</h1>
                    <p>
                    I quickly discovered the plethora of resources available: Coursera, edX, CodeAcademy, the youtube channel of every CS undergrad with a whiteboard, and the list goes on!
                    Having too many resources to choose from is a damn good problem to have, but a problem nonetheless.
                    I found myself stuck in a loop, comparing this, analyzing that - all the while making no progress.
                    Working in circles, I knew I needed to pick something to get the ball rolling.
                    <br>
                    I consistently found free courses from universities to be receiving the highest praise, and decided to follow MIT's curriculum for a few reasons.
                    Firstly, I could be confident in the breadth and depth of topics covered.
                    As one of the top engineering universities in the world, I knew their curriculum would be pristine.
                    Secondly, there were plenty of resources available via their open-courseware platforms (more on this shortly).
                    Most courses have everything from tutorial videos to exams and all for free!
                    Moreover, the structured curriculumn would prevent me from needing to waste time planning and comparing courses,
                    because a regimented plan had already been created for me.
                    <br>
                <h1>Curriculum</h1>
                    <p>
                        My engineering degree endowed me with the prerequisite math knowledge for the computer science curriculum.
                        Furthermore, complementary electives in the humanities taken in my undergrad and required for a standard MIT degree would play no role in advancing my computer science
                        knowledge. Therefore, I decided to focus soley on the final third of MIT's computer science curriculum, comprised of the core computer science requirements.
                        <br>
                        MIT's curriculum, course 6-3, is outlined <a class='para_link' href='http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/'>here</a>, and my progress, below.
                    </p>

                <!--<img src='images/MIT_flowchart.png'>-->
                <img src='images/MIT_flowchartblank.png'>
                <h1>Methodology</h1>
                <p>MIT has three main branches for their open-courseware resources:
                <ul>
                    <li>edX.org</li>
                    <li>Open Learning Library</li>
                    <li>MIT OCW</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                The first of these resources, edX, emmulates end-to-end MIT courses
                with start/end dates, live teaching support, auto-graders, exams, and
                certifications for courses passed. On the other end of this spectrum
                is MIT OCW which is completely self-guided but still with all MIT
                lectures, assignments, labs, exams, each with their respective solutions
                available. There is not however, a certification available for completion.
                Between these two resources is the Open Learning Library with auto-graded
                assignments and homeworks. For each course I prioritized edX availability, then OLL and finally MIT OCW,
                to ensure I was taking advantage of the most resources possible.
                </p>

                      <p>
                         This course offered through edX introduced me to some core python programming concepts including its main data types, object oriented programming, complexity analysis and testing/debugging.
                         Mid-lecture questions and weekly assignments helped to solidify concepts, and exams tested the congregation of all concepts visited throughout the course.
                         I first took this course on my own through MIT open-courseware, but circled back to take the verified track on edX in 2021.

                          This course is not part of MIT's CS curriculum, but offered exciting lectures and immersive assignments that
                          that would help to improve my understanding and capabilities with respect to the core concepts introduced
                          in 6.0001. The key concepts covered include optimization, object oriented programming, and stats.
                          Much like 6.0001, I first took this course through MIT OCW but am circling back to complete it through edX to earn the certificate.

                          This class was really the meat-and-potatoes of improving my programming skills. 12 weeks, with 10 assignments,
                          each of which has over 20 built in tests to be passed in order to verify the functionality of your code.
                          This course covered design paradignms, recursion, graph search, object oriented programming and much more.
                          Discussions with MIT students verified that this course was almost entirely assignments based.
                          As a result, I only focused on recitations and assignments for this course.

                          This course lived up to its reputation and was my favourite class thusfar! Its theortical concepts and mathematical rigor
                          reminded me of my undergraduate classes. Though, I am just beginning the long road to interview prep,
                          and so it would not surprise me if my opinion is starkly different in 6 months.

                          MIT's open learning library had tremendous lectures, and auto graded weekly excersises, labs, and homeworks.
                          This course took more time than any other class, over 150 hours, especially since I needed to brush up on
                          my multivariable calculus.
